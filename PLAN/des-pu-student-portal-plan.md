# DES Unified Platform — Project Bible

> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Status:** Pre-Development  
> **Team Size:** 2  
> **Target:** 1 Month Build Sprint

## 🧠 What Is This?

DES Unified Platform is an all-in-one college portal built exclusively for **DES Pune University** students and faculty. Think of it as:

> **Google Classroom + WhatsApp + Discord + GitHub Codespaces** — fused into one platform, locked to `@despuniversity.edu.in` emails, and built from the ground up for the DES campus experience.

This is not an ERP replacement. It's not an attendance tracker. It's a **living digital campus** — where students collaborate, learn, communicate, build projects, and share knowledge, all in one place without switching between 5 different apps.

### The Core Problem It Solves

Right now DES students are scattered across:
- WhatsApp groups for communication (chaotic, no structure)
- Google Classroom for assignments (works but isolated)
- Random Google Drive links for notes (no curation, no discovery)
- No platform for project collaboration or finding teammates

DES Unified Platform kills all of that with one login.

## 🔐 Access & Identity

Only people with a valid `@despuniversity.edu.in` email can create an account. No exceptions. Accounts are tied to ERP data — your department, semester, roll number, and enrolled subjects are pre-loaded. You don't set those up, you just log in and you're already placed in your correct academic spaces.

### Roles

| Role | Who They Are |
|---|---|
| **Student** | Default role for all enrolled students |
| **Faculty** | Verified teaching staff with a faculty badge |
| **Admin** | Platform administrators (moderators, IT staff) |
| **Contributor** | Students who actively contribute notes/resources (earned) |
| **Project Leader** | Students who create and manage projects on the marketplace |

### Profile

- **Editable:** Username, bio, interests, profile photo
- **Non-editable (from ERP):** Full name, roll number, DES email, department, semester
- Online / Offline / Away status
- Privacy controls

## 🏫 Academic Structure

The entire platform is organized around how your college actually works:

```
Department
  └── Semester
        └── Subject
              ├── Discussion Forum
              ├── Study Materials
              ├── Topper Notes
              └── Faculty Announcements
```

When you log in for the first time, you're automatically enrolled in your department's spaces, your semester's spaces, and all your current subjects — based on ERP data. No manual setup.

Faculty members are assigned to their respective subjects and can post announcements, upload resources, and moderate discussions within those spaces.
